# PrintR 
Welcome to PrintR!

PrintR is a web application built in React that allows you to send a message to a thermal printer connected at home. All you have to do is enter your message, press the submit button and your message will be sent to the thermal printer.

We make sure that the message is transferred quickly and securely. You can also easily monitor the status of your message, so you know if it was successfully sent.

Hope you enjoy using PrintR!
